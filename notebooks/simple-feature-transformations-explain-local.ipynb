    "This notebook illustrates how to use interpret-community to help interpret a binary classification model using an IBM dataset with employee attrition data. It uses one-to-one and one-to-many feature transformations from the raw data to engineered features. The one-to-many feature transformations include one hot encoding for categorical features. The one-to-one feature transformations apply standard scaling on numeric features. The interpret-community tabular data explainer in this repo is then used to obtain raw feature importances.\n",
